           <p class='purpose'>"James helped me add not only strength, but also flexibility. He increased my stride by nearly 1/2 a foot and added explosion to my delivery which took my fastball in high school <strong>from low 80's to upwards of 87mph</strong>, and ultimately led me to playing at the Division I level for UNC-Asheville with a 90mph fastball.
