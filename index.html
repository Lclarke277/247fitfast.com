Whoever believes in Jesus Christ [born-again] is not condemned, but whoever does not believe [is not born-again] is condemned already because they have not believed [been born-again] in the name of the only begotten Son of God.

            <p class='purpose'>The Bible says that all men are sinners.</p>
            
        <p class='quote'>"For all [all who have ever lived]have sinned and come short of the Glory of God" Romans 3:23</p>
            
        <p class='purpose'>Our sins have separated us from God. God made man in His image. He gave man the ability to choose right from wrong. We choose to sin. Your sins keep us from God. God's Word also says that sin must be paid for</p>
            
            <p class='quote'>"For the wages of sin is death."  Romans 6:23</p>
            
        <p class='purpose'>Wages mean payment. The payment of our sin is death, hell and the lake of fire after; forever. If we continue in our sin, we shall die without Jesus Christ and be without God forever. The good news is that Jesus Christ paid for our sins</p>
            
        <p class='quote'>"But God demonstrates His own love towards us, in that while we were still sinners [not born-again] Jesus Christ died for us." Romans 5:8</p>
            
        <p class='purpose'>All of our sins were laid on Jesus Christ on the Cross. He paid our sin debt for us. The Lord Jesus Christ died on the Cross, and He arose from the dead with the keys of death, hell and the grave. Jesus Christ is Alive forevermore. We must personally pray and receive Jesus Christ by Faith</p>

        <p class='quote'>"For whoever calls on the name of the Lord [Jesus Christ] shall be saved." Romans 10:13<br>
        “Jesus answered and said  Most assuredly,I say to you,unless one is born-again they cannot see The Kingdom Of God [Heaven] John 3:3</p>
            
        <p class='purpose'>Just as God gave us the freewill to choose to sin,the same freewill is used to accept Jesus Christ to be born-Again. Pray and receive Jesus Christ as your Savior</p>
            
        <p class='quote'>"For whoever [this is you] calls on the Name of Jesus Christ will be saved [born-again]"  Romans 10:13</p>

        <p class='quote'>Pray:
            'Lord, I know that I am a sinner and lost without a relationship with You. If I died today I would not go to Heaven. I repent [turn away] all of my sins, please forgive me of them. Come into my Life and be My Savior. Wash me clean with your Blood that was shed on the Cross for me. Baptize me now with the Holy Spirit. Help me to live for You the rest of my life. In Jesus Name, amen.</p>

        Everlasting life begins the second you receive Jesus Christ as your Savior.<br>
